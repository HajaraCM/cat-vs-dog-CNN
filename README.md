# cat-vs-dog-CNN

## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. It provides an end-to-end workflow from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Features

* **Binary Classification**: Classifies images as either a cat or a dog.

* **Preprocessing**: Resizes, normalizes, and augments the dataset for better model performance.

* **Model Training and Evaluation**: Uses CNN architecture for high accuracy.

## Dataset

Use publicly available datasets such as:

Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset

Ensure the dataset is downloaded and organized in the following structure:
```
dataset/
|-- train/
|   |-- cats/
|   |-- dogs/
|-- test/
    |-- cats/
    |-- dogs/
```
## Results


Future Work

Enhance the model using transfer learning (e.g., ResNet or VGG).

Add support for multi-class classification (e.g., other animals).

Improve real-time classification with webcam integration.
